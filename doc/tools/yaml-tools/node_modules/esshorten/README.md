### esshorten

esshorten provides name mangler, this shorten names in JavaScript code. mangler accepts JavaScript AST and generate modified AST with shortened names.

### usage

We can use this with,

```js
esshorten.mangle(AST);
```

And we can pass options to mangler,

```js
esshorten.mangle(AST, {
    // If false, AST is copied deeply (default: true)
    destructive: false,
    // If false, avoid [JSC bug](https://github.com/mozilla/sweet.js/issues/138) (default: false)
    distinguishFunctionExpressionScope: false
});
```

When destructive option is set to false, esshorten copies AST and modifies it.
